This is the poem that I  
don't want to write  
I would surely call it something like For You  
I will hope that you read it  
I will hope that you won't read it  

I will try to find a way to sneak words I love you  
I will try to find a path to sneak word I miss you  
But as always the words will return back  
Weeping and screaming that it could not find you  
scolding and hating itself for not finding you  
but to realize that you were hiding from it  
the poem weeps for you and wets the paper  
but it won't find you  
seeing you were hiding From me  

The poem curse me for burning our bridges  
it curses me to be the reason for hiding  
and it stays there in the corner  
weeping and screaming so that it could find her  
hoping that it will make us closer  
but to only realize  
the weeping of poem has wet itself and made it faded  
just like you  

The poet laughs at itself with disgust  
where the creation strives to find her  
The poet blames itself for everything  
and weeps with the poem  
just looking for her  
just to realize she was the sun and he was shadow  

I will write a poem  
but it just won't be just words ,just letters , just a piece of papers  

It will always be something like you  
something like my heart  

It will always be for you ...
