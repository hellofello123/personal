The nights don't only come with you and me together  
It comes with dark and silence  
It comes with watery eyes  
It comes with the loudest silence  

And  
This silence has grown  
so swollen I can't rest my weight on  
it, can't stand on it, can't stand it, and  
everything I want  
is on the other side  
of the bridge I burned.  

The days where I built the bridge  
was burnt away by the nights  
and I fear the nights  
as I feared you will get away from me  

I get wrapped by silence  
I get wrapped by cold nights  
I shake at night when I sleep  
Now I can't cry  
I just shake by the cold  
but as always you are there for me  
You wrap me around you  
And I say I can't cry  
But the mornings were always dim for me  

A wrecking ball has never  
rebuilt a house that it destroyed  

scissors have never glued pages  
back inside a book  

People of glass hearts have never learned  
to make things right  
And I was the one to break my own glass  
and the silence follows me  
This silence has grown  
so swollen I can't rest my weight on  
it, can't stand on it, can't stand it, and  
everything I want  
is on the other side  
of the bridge I burned.
