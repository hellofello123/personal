I was the ghost and You were The goddess  
I dragged you in my pit  
but you made me human  
you gave a hundred lives to live  
but not you by my side  
I screamed like a lonely ghost  
to realize I was always a lonely ghost  
who dragged people to his pit  

I now know that even if it is a hundred live I can't be a part of your life  
but if I had a hundred lives  
I am happy to live when  
I can make you happy even in a single life  
But can I  
it's just an imagination strikes the brain  
it suggest me to not hold close anything  
he warns me I will be the cause of grief  
and he makes me realize  
even in a hundred lives you won't be ever happy  

The thoughts strike why can't you do it in this life  
and It makes me realize  
the only thing different in this life  
is that I have fewer hours to miss you in sunshine  
And more to miss you in the dark  
and in the same dark  
I stand and scream  
"I don't love her anymore "  
But the nights and dreams makes a lair of me
