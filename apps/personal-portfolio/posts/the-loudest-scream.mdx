The conflicts and the quarrel  
that resonates within my mind is  
like the loudest silence.  
Like the quietest  
scream.  

The dreams of You arises in my mind  
where I see you and  
curse myself when I wake up  
I stopped crying when i saw you in my dreams  
I saw you happy as you are  

I see you and dream within a dream  
where i make you and keep you happy  
but the quarrels and conflicts wakes me up  
with watery eyes  
searching for you  

My eyes asks me how much you will dream about her  
and i reply till you go dry  
my eyes pities me  
leave the attachment  
let her go  
but little do anyone know  
how much you were meant to me  
little did anyone know  
If i had hundred lives to live  
I will always try to be with you  
and try to be better for you  

I finally kept you with me  
and amazed with me  
you replied in my dream How can you keep me  
And I replied  
This is how I keep you -  
tucked between my clasped fingers  
beneath my bowed head.  
This is how I keep you  
like the loudest silence.  
Like the quietest  
scream.
