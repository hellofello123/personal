I wish many things  
I make hopes for anything  
when I know  
when I realize  
you are nowhere near me  
when I realize I am nowhere near you  

wishes makes me overthink  
hopes make me realize  
but hope wishes does't disappoint  

I remember  
And I know You don't  
you were sleeping  
i whispered and prayed the whole night when we talked  
for the first time it was something that I truly wanted  
I could lose Anything to want that  
But  
I never hoped to lose you just to want you  
I remembered I prayed to god to let me marry her  
I remembered I wished I could be with her  
And then I hoped I was someone better for her  
then the god laughed at me  
I questioned why he was laughing  
Then every time I prayed and wished and prayed It was just a joke for him  

I became Angry and challenged him  
i tried and begged and cried  
but the god laughed and laughed  
and before I knew  
I was the one to break all of it  
to make my hope false  
where I hoped she was happy to talk to me  
But then the god whispered  
you are just a mistake  

I prayed to make me a better person and be with her  
But this Time  
I laughed with God without understanding what was funny  
Then I realized  
Then I laughed  
Then I laughed  
Then I knew everything I prayed was flooded by me  
then I laughed  
as a mistake  
as a joke  
where I still hope I could Be a better person for her  
where i still hope she would call me and talk to me  
And I laugh  
and I laugh
