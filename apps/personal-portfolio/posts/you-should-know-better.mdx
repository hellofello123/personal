We grow from the ground. Each step  
forward is a rending of roots. I have heard you say goodbye more times  
than I've heard you say my name.  
You come back, isn't that something, say it's something, say something.  
I have no torn roots. I am where you  
left me, tangled in cracked sidewalk  
cement, my own worst enemy. I grow  
in the shadow of my own heartbreak,  
and it is bigger than I am, so I don't  
grow at all. You have torn every root that grew you,  
and look how you tower.  

Somewhere, you say I should've  
known better.  

Here, I wonder what I would've  
become in the sunlight.  

Somewhere I would say I moved on   
somewhere I say you should have know better  

I move on   
one foot in front of  
the other, do you hear me   

Are my eyes open then  
why can't I see you  
are my ears uncovered then  
why cant i hear you  
Do you still love me  
then why can't I feel you  

I move on  
One foot in front of other ,do you hear me  

Do you, can you , will you
