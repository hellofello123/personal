I tried to hide it  
I tied to stop it  
I tried to control it  
But could I  

The day it came out  
it destroyed everything  
Not me but everything  
where I was searching For something or someone  
but The thing that was only left was the it  

I questioned what was it  
and it replied  
I make ghosts  
then I realized  

I was the Ghost and you were the goddess  
you tried to make me human  
but I was the ghost  
who was blind  
But I dragged you in my pit  

Then the it replied  
its the time  
then the it showed that  
I was the ghost that dragged you  

Despite that  
and not fearing what you might be  
You kept company to the lonely ghost  
and made him happy  

The ghost who didn't know what was love  
was a lonely ghost surrounded by it  
when the ghost saw you  
He wanted to change  
but the ghost was surrounded by it  

Despite knowing that in a greed of being with a goddess  
he dragged her  
and it responded  
shall i take over you  
when the lonely ghost woke up  
he saw that  
he was again a lonely ghost  
and she was a ghost in his memories  

he cried  
he dreamt that it was just a dream  
but as it was  
the onlyone with him was it  

He cursed it  
why did he took over  
why did he made him lonely  
then the it replied  

then the it replied  
I am you  
I am your desire  
you didn't wanted to drag the goddess in your pit  
and you were the one who took over  
you never slept to wake up  
you made yourself lonely  
and I am nothing but a ghost of your happy memories with her  

And  
I am not alone  
cause  
Our ghosts keeps me company,  
so  
We are laughing, and we are happy,  
and I have never  
felt more 
alone
