I don't love you anymore  
I don't want you anymore  
I don't Know you anymore  
I don't feel you Anymore  
And you don't exist anymore  

Wish I could say It  
wish It had been true  
Wish I could scream It  
wish I could pray it  

Just like The road diverged in the woods  
I want to travel the path less painful  
Just like the conflicts between us  
I want to travel the path less painful  
I want to travel the the path with you  

The don't surround me to make it real  
I curse The don't  
I fight the don't  
But I Know now  
I will always lose in conflicts  

I gaze the sky  
I see you  
I gaze the people I see you smiling  
And I see me nowere near you  
I see me in the pit no one could remove me from  

I gaze at our photos  
I see the memories  
I see the conflicts  
I see You  
I dream when the sun shines  
I see you  
I see you  
when i close my eyes  
I see you high above the pit giving me a hand  
But I gaze at you  
where your hand is fading away  
just because of pit  
just because of me  

And i shout  
I don't love you anymore  
I don't want you anymore  
I don't Know you anymore  
I don't feel you Anymore  
And you don't exist anymore  

And i whisper wish it was true  
wish i didn't love you
