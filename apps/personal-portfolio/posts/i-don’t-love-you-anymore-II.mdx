I don't want you anymore  
I don't Know you anymore  
I don't feel you Anymore  
And you don't exist anymore  

I think I can make it true   
but when I look at the pit   
I see my feelings   
and wish it made you happy   
and wish you loved me   

I wish many things   
which are never to be fulfilled   
when I wished Someone would love me   
But for anyone in the world   
being with me was a mistake   

I wish I was not a mistake to Anyone   
I wish somebody could understand me   
I wish you would call me   
I wish you would scold Me   
I wish i was just not a stranger for you   
I wish you see how much I love you   
I wish if only to make you sad i shouldn't have existed   
I wish I was a better person to you   

But Little did I know the pit was only made with wishes   
where I looked at your hand up above   
where your hand faded because of me   
and I was there in the pit full of wishes   
where I disgust myself but still hope for you to call me   
where I still hope that you will lend me a hand   
and I will escape from pit and be someone of value to anyone   

And I wish   
I don't love you anymore  
I don't want you anymore  
I don't Know you anymore  
I don't feel you Anymore  
And you don't exist anymore  
and wish it was true  
and i wish it was true
