if you wonder why I sold my love to you so cheaply because  
you convinced me that was the most  
I would ever get for it  

if you wonder had I been crying  
I'm not crying, that's just dust, that's just the sun  
that's just you leaving in my eye  

If you wonder how fragile I am  
I am less fragile thing now than the one you held  
I am neither unbreakable or unbroken,  
But I wonder if I need to be dropped from higher peak  
to make a crack on me  
I won't break for arms like yours  
I won't break for heart like yours  
Insurance didn't cover for this  
I had to pay out of pocket for the ways you wrecked me  

if you wonder about me  
I still don't hear your voice in quiet moments anymore  
All I hear is silence, but - I still think it's yours  

If you wonder why I don't write you anymore,  
it's because I have run out of ways to say, you hurt me but I still love you  

Here, at least, I can pretend it's poetry
