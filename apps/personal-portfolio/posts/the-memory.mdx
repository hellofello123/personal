I paint us in the memory  
as I wanted us to be  
i pull little moments that were real  
probably real for me  
but nothing for you  
the moments that were magical  
the haunting ones  
real for me but nothing for you  
the ones That I cannot shake  
and I cover it until its shadows become my nights thinking of you  
you and only you  

I paint you and me  
but you took the colors away from me  
the will of me  
or I did  
when I found that you said there was nothing real  
I laugh at it as i was real as your words are real  
I laugh at myself if i would paint anyone with me  


The memory makes me stay up all night  
it makes me play a game  
the kind I should not play  

I think of things you said  
I think of the promises I made to myself  
and try to decipher truths from lies  

Some nights I make them all lies  
and fall asleep hating you  

Other times I make them all truths  
and fall asleep missing you  

Its the type of game  
I should not play  
because it's the kind I cannot win
